# Dream Mobile Platform

I have written [a blog post](https://ricoruotongjia.medium.com/set-up-raspberry-pi-4b-as-a-mobile-platform-7448e94a04dc) in terms of setting this up

## Set up
This package is a "one-stop-shop" for Rpi setup. 
1. Go through the set up steps [../../README.md] for basic Rpi set up
2. See the comments section in [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) to pull the image and run a container
    - The container should have everything you need to running all functionalities
